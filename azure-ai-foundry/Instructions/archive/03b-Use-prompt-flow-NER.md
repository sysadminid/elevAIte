# Use prompt flow for Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Extracting valuable information from text is known as Named Entity Recognition (NER). Entities are key words that are of interest to you in a given text.

![Entity extraction](./media/get-started-prompt-flow-use-case.gif)

Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to perform NER. To create an application that takes a text as input and outputs entities, you can create a flow that uses a LLM node with prompt flow.

In this exercise, you'll use Azure AI Foundry portal's prompt flow to create an LLM application that expects an entity type and text as input. It calls a GPT model from Azure OpenAI through a LLM node to extract the required entity from the given text, cleans the result and outputs the extracted entities.

![Exercise overview](./media/get-started-lab.png)

You first need to create a project in the Azure AI Foundry portal to create the necessary Azure resources. Then, you can deploy a GPT model with the Azure OpenAI service. Once you have the necessary resources, you can create the flow. Finally you'll run the flow to test it and view the sample output.

## Create a project in the Azure AI Foundry portal

You start by creating an Azure AI Foundry portal project and an Azure AI Hub to support it.

1. In a web browser, open [https://ai.azure.com](https://ai.azure.com) and sign in using your Azure credentials.
1. In the home page, select **+ Create project**.
1. In the **Create a project** wizard you can see all the Azure resources that will be automatically created with your project, or you can customize the following settings by selecting **Customize** before selecting **Create**:

    - **Project name**: *A unique name for your project*
    - **Hub**: *Create a new hub with the following settings:*
    - **Hub name**: *A unique name*
    - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*
    - **Resource group**: *A new resource group*
    - **Location**: Select **Help me choose** and then select **gpt-4** in the Location helper window and use the recommended region\*
    - **Connect Azure AI Services or Azure OpenAI**: (New) *Autofills with your selected hub name*
    - **Connect Azure AI Search**: Skip connecting

    > \* Azure OpenAI resources are constrained at the tenant level by regional quotas. The listed regions in the location helper include default quota for the model type(s) used in this exercise. Randomly choosing a region reduces the risk of a single region reaching its quota limit. In the event of a quota limit being reached later in the exercise, there's a possibility you may need to create another resource in a different region. Learn more about [model availability per region](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#availability)

1. If you selected **Customize**, select **Next** and review your configuration.
1. Select **Create** and wait for the process to complete.

## Deploy a GPT model

To use a LLM model in prompt flow, you need to deploy a model first. The Azure AI Foundry portal allows you to deploy OpenAI models that you can use in your flows.

1. In the navigation pane on the left, under **My assets**, select the **Models + endpoints** page.
1. Select **+ Deploy model** and **Deploy base model**.
1. Create a new deployment of the **gpt-4** model with the following settings by selecting **Customize** in the deployment details:
   
    - **Deployment name**: *A unique name for your model deployment*
    - **Deployment type**: Standard
    - **Model version**: *Select the default version*
    - **AI resource**: *Select the resource created previously*
    - **Tokens per Minute Rate Limit (thousands)**: 5K
    - **Content filter**: DefaultV2
    - **Enable dynamic quota**: Disabled
   
Now that you have your language model deployed, you can create a flow in Azure AI Foundry portal that calls the deployed model.

## Create and run a flow in the Azure AI Foundry portal

Now that you have all necessary resources provisioned, you can create a flow.

### Create a new flow

To create a new flow with a template, you can select one of the types of flows you want to develop.

1. In the navigation pane on the left, under **Build and customize**, select **Prompt flow**.
1. Select **+ Create** to create a new flow.
1. Create a new **Standard flow** and enter `entity-recognition` as folder name.

    <summary><b>Troubleshooting tip</b>: Permissions error</summary>
    <p>If you receive a permissions error when you create a new prompt flow, try the following to troubleshoot:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In the Azure portal, select the AI Services resource.</li>
        <li>Under Resource Management, in the Identity tab, confirm that it is system assigned managed identity.</li>
        <li>Navigate to the associated Storage Account. On the IAM page, add role assignment <em>Storage blob data reader</em>.</li>
        <li>Under <strong>Assign access to</strong>, choose <strong>Managed Identity</strong>, <strong>+ Select members</strong>, and select the <strong>All system-assigned managed identities</strong>.</li>
        <li>Review and assign to save the new settings and retry the previous step.</li>
    </ul>
</details>

A standard flow with one input, two nodes, and one output is created for you. You'll update the flow to take two inputs, extract entities, clean up the output from the LLM node, and return the entities as output.

### Start the automatic runtime

To test your flow, you need compute. The necessary compute is made available to you through the runtime.

1. After creating the new flow that you named `entity-recognition`, the flow should open in the studio.
1. Select **Start compute session** from the top bar.
1. The compute session will take 1-3 minutes to start.

### Configure the inputs

The flow you'll create will take two inputs: a text and the type of entity you want to extract from the text.

1. Under **Inputs**, one input is configured named `topic` of type `string`. Change the existing input and update with the following settings:
    - **Name**: `entity_type`
    - **Type**: `string`
    - **Value**: `job title`
1. Select **Add input**.
1. Configure the second input to have the following settings:
    - **Name**: `text`
    - **Type**: `string`
    - **Value**: `The software engineer is working on a new update for the application.`

### Configure the LLM node

The standard flow already includes a node that uses the LLM tool. You can find the node in your flow overview. The default prompt asks for a joke. You'll update the LLM node to extract entities based on the two inputs specified in the previous section.

1. Navigate to the **LLM node** named `joke`.
1. Replace the name with `NER_LLM`
1. For **Connection**, select the connection that was created for you when you created the AI hub.
1. For **deployment_name**, select the `gpt-4` model you deployed.
1. Replace the prompt field with the following code:

   ```yml
   system:

   Your task is to find entities of a certain type from the given text content.
   If there're multiple entities, please return them all with comma separated, e.g. "entity1, entity2, entity3".
   You should only return the entity list, nothing else.
   If there's no such entity, please return "None".

   user:
   
   Entity type: {{entity_type}}
   Text content: {{text}}

   Entities:
   ```

1. Select **Validate and parse input**.
1. Within the LLM node, in the **Inputs** section, configure the following:
    - For `entity_type`, select the value `${inputs.entity_type}`.
    - For `text`, select the value `${inputs.text}`.

Your LLM node will now take the entity type and text as inputs, include it in the prompt you specified and send the request to your deployed model.

### Configure the Python node

To extract only the key information from the result of the model, you can use the Python tool to clean up the output of the LLM node.

1. Navigate to the Python node named `echo`.
1. Replace the name with `cleansing`.
1. Replace the code with the following:

   ```python
   from typing import List
   from promptflow import tool
    
    
   @tool
   def cleansing(entities_str: str) -> List[str]:
       # Split, remove leading and trailing spaces/tabs/dots
       parts = entities_str.split(",")
       cleaned_parts = [part.strip(" \t.\"") for part in parts]
       entities = [part for part in cleaned_parts if len(part) > 0]
       return entities
    
   ```

1. Select **Validate and parse input**.
1. Within the Python node, in the **Inputs** section, set the value of `entities_str` to `${NER_LLM.output}`.

### Configure the output

Finally, you can configure the output of the whole flow. You only want one output to your flow, which should be the extracted entities.

1. Navigate to the flow's **Outputs**.
1. For **Name**, enter `entities`.
1. For **Value**, select `${cleansing.output}`.

### Run the flow

Now that you've developed the flow, you can run it to test it. Since you've added default values to the inputs, you can easily test the flow in the studio.

1. Select **Run** to test the flow.
1. Wait until the run is completed.
1. Select **View outputs**. A pop-up should appear showing you the output for the default inputs. Optionally, you can also inspect the logs.

## Delete Azure resources

When you finish exploring the Azure AI Foundry portal, you should delete the resources youâ€™ve created to avoid unnecessary Azure costs.

- Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) at `https://portal.azure.com`.
- In the Azure portal, on the **Home** page, select **Resource groups**.
- Select the resource group that you created for this exercise.
- At the top of the **Overview** page for your resource group, select **Delete resource group**.
- Enter the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**.
