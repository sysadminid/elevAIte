Hi, Ava. How are you?Hey,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.520
Jenny. I'm doing well. How's things with

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.320
you?Good. Keeping busy with the product

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.560
launch coming up. Aren't we all?

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.880
Hey there, Max. Hi, Ava. Hey,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.840
Jenny. Sorry I'm late. My last meeting

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.720
ran longer than expected. No problem.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.360
OK, so I just wanted to check in on the

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.080
launch event plans. Jenny,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.840
how are we doing on collateral for the

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.640
event?Hold on, let me share a slide.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.320
I have a draft designed for posters, and

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.840
I found these cool little water bottles

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.360
that I thought might make good giveaways

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.160
for attendees. Yes, those look great.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.600
Yeah, I like it. Do you have costs for

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.360
them?We'll need to make sure there's

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.760
budget. I've reached out to the supplier

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.640
for a quote. That's great, Jenny. Can you

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.080
get an estimate to us by the end of the

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.640
week?Sure, I'll do that.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.880
Fantastic. OK, let's meet again

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.200
next week. Max, can you schedule a

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.680
meeting?Sure. I'll send an

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.400
invite. See you all later.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.920
Thanks. Great work, team. Bye.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.200
Have a great day.
