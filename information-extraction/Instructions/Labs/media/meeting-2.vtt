Hi, Harry. How are you?I'm good, Lisa.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.280
How's things at the office?Okay, I guess.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.600
I'm about to present our V2 release plans

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.440
to the board, so I'm a bit nervous.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.640
You'll be fine. You've got this. Anything

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.880
I can do to help. Thanks.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.920
Yeah, do you have the user adoption

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.640
projections for the first three months?

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.640
Yeah, hold on. I can present them on a

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.080
slide. Can you see it?

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.760
Yes. This is great, Harry.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.480
Can you send this to me by e-mail?Sure

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.000
thing. I'll send it right away. Now go in

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.440
and press the board. Will do.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.240
Thanks.
